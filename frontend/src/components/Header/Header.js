Their enthusiastic response proved that Pizzeria's Fresh Pan Pizza is the Tastiest Pan Pizza. Ever!
Ever since we launched the Tastiest Pan Pizza, ever, people have not been able to resist the softest, cheesiest, crunchiest, butteriest Domino's Fresh Pan Pizza. They have been leaving the stage in the middle of a performance and even finding excuses to be disqualified in a football match.
